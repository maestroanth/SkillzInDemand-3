MVA Angular Lesson 5
*NOTE: Routing lessons won't work unless I set up a localhost server at the very least*

Pretty URLS
	Pretty URLS get rid of the hashtag angular uses by default
	To get clean URLs, configure $locationProvider and set base for relative urls (set to HTML5 to true)
	Configuring $locationProvider, will use the HistoryAPI - resulting in clean urls 
	HistoryAPI is to use with back button

About UIRouter
	Routing framework built by Angular team
	Changes view based on application state, not just route URL
	Can still use routing to change views with no URL change
	UI-Router is separate and needs to be loaded
	Links use ui-sref
	Can change view based on application states (like if a folder is open or w/e)
	Remember to include in library and as a dependency to use new providers

	use only ng-router or ui-router no need to use both

	The power of UIRouter is you can have nested states, i.e. home.selected
