MVA Angular Lesson 3

What is an Expression?
	Javascript code snippets placed in bindings {{Hello Biatches!}}
	Evaluated against a scope object
	Forgiving, don't throw an error
	Can use filters with expressions to format data
	Expressions do not have access to window, document, or location

Cheatsheet of everything an Expression can be in AngularJS at:
http://teropa.info/images/angular_expressions_cheatsheet.pdf

Cannot do complicated if/else statements or large logic flows, but can do ternary a ? b : c

One-time binding. Binds only once instead of it constantly checking (like use for titles ::event.title)

What are Filters?
	Formats the value of an expression
	Filters can be applied in the view
	{{employees.array | filter: 's'}}
	Filters applied in the view can be costly as they are re-evaluated
	Filters can be used elsewhere: controllers, services etc.

Built-in Filters
	orderBy
	limitTo
	lowercase
	uppercase
	filter (filter by a search)
	currency
	number
	date

Creating a Custom Filter
	Register a new filter factory function
	Return a filter function that takes the input value as the first argument
	Filter function should be stateless (typically)
