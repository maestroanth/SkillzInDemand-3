Modules Setup

A module is comprised of configuration and run blocks

Configuration Blocks- executed during configuration and registration. Only providers and constants can be passed.

Run Blocks - happen after the injector is created. Only instances and constants can be passed in.

Some convenience methods for this

Run blocks is like a main method - it kickstarts the application

Modules can depend on other modules

They are only loaded once - when they are loaded they are stored in what's called a "registry"
