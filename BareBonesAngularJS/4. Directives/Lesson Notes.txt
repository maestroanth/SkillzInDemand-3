MVA Angular Lesson 4

What are Directives?

	AngularJS directives are markers on the DOM that tells the Angular compiler 
	to attach behavior or transform the DOM element

	Directives can be placed on the DOM as:
		- Element directives
		- Attribute directives
		- CSS class directives
		- Comment directives

	Directives are used to get into the DOM instead of doing it in controllers

	
	
Types of Directives

	Element Directive
		<product-description></product-description>
	
	Attribute Directive (appends to an element)
		<H3 product-description></H3>

	Comment Directive (a directive that gives information usually in testing)
		<product-description></product-description>

	Class Directive
		<div class="product-description"></div> 
		
"dashes are conventionally directives that is an indicator that a directive is 
being used"

Built in Directives

	AngularJS provides a bunch of built in directives
	Some of these override built in HTML elements to provide additional functionality 
	- like <form>
	Other directives are visible through the ng- prefix

	For example, ng-app is a directive to tell angular to instantiate the app here.
	Ng-*** are the directives: ng-class, ng-repeat.

Quick List of Angular Built in Directives

	ng-href ng-src ng-disabled ng-checked ng-class ng-style ng-selected ng-app
	ng-controller ng-show ng-hide ng-include

	you can use ng-show for tabs
	like ng-click="eventtab.setTab(0)" ng-click="eventtab.setTab(1)"
	ng-show="(eventtab.tab==0)" ng-show="(eventtab.tab==0)"

*directives don't run locally without some special port starts, only http and https browsers usually prevent*
