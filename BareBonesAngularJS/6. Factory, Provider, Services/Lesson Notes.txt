MVA Angular Lesson 6

If it's not reading int .json make sure it's config to accept .json file types

Getting External Data
	$http = built in resource to make rest requests

Service Components
	Angular has many built in Service or Provider components
	$anchorScroll, $http, $window, $timeout

	Use the following to refactor code to help keep controllers lean:

Services
	Syntax: module.service('serviceName', function);
	Result: When declaring serviceName as an injectable argument you will be provided with an instance of the function. I.e. new 'serviceName()'.

Factories
	Syntax: module.factory('factoryName', function);
	Result: When declaring factoryName as an injectable argument you will be provided with the value that is returned by invoking the function 
	reference passed to module.factory.

Providers
	Syntax: module.provider('providerName', function);
	Result: When declaring providerName as an injectable argument you will be provided with ProviderFunction().$get(). The constructor function is
	instantiated before the $get method is called - ProviderFunction is the function reference passed to module.provider.
	Used in configuration

What is a Provider?
	Application wide business logic that does need to be configured
	Twitter API, facebook login etc. where values are need to be configured before the service can work (typically APIs)

What is a Service?
	API that doesn't need configuration to work and just be called.

The guy at the end did tie is all together connecting this AngularJS Client to .Net MVC API to have it go roundtrip which I'll be
probably doing as a final project to tie .net server and Angular Client frameworks altogether.
